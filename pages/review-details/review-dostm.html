            To say Pink Floyd’s 1973 magnum opus The Dark Side of the Moon is just a great art-rock record
            is to misunderstand its core concept. 
            It is THE concept album, a continuous telling of a tale that functions less like a collection
            of songs and more like a documentary of humanity. While the album is celebrated for
            its cover and commercial ubiquity, its genius lies in the convergence of three elements:
            the structural uniqueness of the record as a musical experience, the grounded philosophical lyricism of Roger Waters,
            and the heavily understated, modal harmonic genius of Richard Wright. While their last album "Obscured by Clouds" was way more
            straightforward in its nature, TDSOTM defines what a concept album should be, holding a mirror to human reality. Roger Waters explores the life
            with its ups and downs, from the beginning to the end, concentrating on themes of mental illness, the direction we propel our lives into, death and greed.
            Yet, amidst Waters’ existential dread, David Gilmour provided the album’s beating heart. His role was to ground the lofty concepts in visceral, blues-soaked emotion, 
            acting as the tether between the band's intellectualism and the listener's gut. In tracks like "Time," 
            Gilmour’s solo part doesn't try to present any technical prowess like a classic 70s guitar solo, and with 
            his phrasing he manages to capture the feeling of time ticking away perfectly, 
            cutting through the mix with a tone that is massive yet deeply melodic. 
            Rick Wright avoided the binary of minor and major, preferring the ambiguity of modes and his jazz influences like Miles Davis. In "Breathe", 
            he oscillated between E minor and A Major. This specific movement is in the Dorian mode, a scale that lacks the leading tone’s urgency to resolve. 
            The result is a harmonic stasis, a feeling of floating in the womb that perfectly combines with the theme of being born.
